README - Harmonator Arpeggiator

Harmonator is a midi arpeggiator oriented towards live performance. You input a rhythm, voice pattern, and then play.

Harmonator is sparse. Chords(or just pitches) are input as a midi stream and "broken" chords are output in the form of another midi stream. In other words, you need minimally a midi keyboard and a midi synth(or soft synth).

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the requirements for installing Harmonator are probably already present on your Linux system. You'll also need a system called Fltk installed. Perform the procedure from within the distribution directory.

1 Run the "configure" script
Run this without arguments normally. It will scan your system for available resources and notify you of shortcomings. "configure --help" can be used list a plethora of switches for customization. Most of the generic switches are explained in file "INSTALL". Two extra package specific ones are defined.

  --disable-library-version-check
                          Disable library version checks(Enabled by default)
  --enable-test-configuration
                          Generate code to build testing version

"configure" normally attempts to check versions of applicable libraries. The first switch disables this check. The second switch configures Harmonator for testing and is probably not necessary.

2. Run "make". This will build a midi clock application and Harmonator proper.
3. Run "make install" to copy files to the normal install sites. You may have to become root to install.
This should give you a working copy of Harmonator that's hooked into your system such that you can run it from a shell. You may want to hook it into whatever menu system you're using. "make uninstall" can be used to remove previously installed files.
